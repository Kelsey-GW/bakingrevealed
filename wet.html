<h2>The Fats</h2>
<p>You can say it about any ingredient in baking seeing as baking is a science whereas cooking is an art but truly, fats are an essential ingredient for bakes to turn out properly. They are a natural control
 for the formation of gluten. As is the job of the wet ingredients, they also tend to bring a large amount of moisture to the bake to help make a lighter and fluffier product. Much like the leavening 
 agents. The common fats you'll come across include:</p>
 <ul>
	<li>Shortening</li>
	<li>Butter</li>
	<li>Margarine</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, you'll come across recipes that call for oil to be added but it really isn't common. Oil tends to produce a heavier finished product than other fats if you just substitute it straight. 
For it to work out, you have to increase the amount of eggs and sugar in your recipe as well. There are similar sentiments for fat free or reduced fat subsitutes. They're best avoided in baking. They 
just lack the fat content needed for most recipes. So though they are an appealing option for the waistline when baking, it's really best to leave them for your toast in the morning.</p>
<p>For the most part, you'll be dealing with butter, margarine and shortening. Margarine and butter have the same fat to water ratio (about 80:20) so they can be used interchangebly. Shortening is 100% 
fat. Usually it's made from vegetable fats but you can find some made from animal fats as well. Both are fine. The main difference comes from using butter or using shortening. Butter has that 20% water 
content so as the bake bakes the steam can activate some gluten formation again resulting in crispier cookies depending on how long you bake it for. The difference you're most likely to notice, 
especially in cookies, is that butter has a lower melting point than shortening. This means that cookies with butter in them will cook flatter and spread. Cookies made with shortening will stay tall.</p>
<p>Due to the higher melting point of shortening, you'll typically see it used in puff pastry recipes. That extra time it spends solid allows the many layers of pastry to rise and become solid before the 
shortening melts away leaving gaps between all the layers. This makes the pastry light and flakey. If butter is used, you'll also get a bit of that creamy taste in your bakes whereas shortening doesn't 
have any natural flavour to bring into the final product.</p>

<h2>Eggs</h2>

<p>Eggs are another very key ingredient to baking. The functions they provide in baking are numerous. They contribute to the structure of the bake, aeration, provide liquid and moisture, fat, protein, as 
well as their own flavour. They're used in baking recipes across the board. Cakes, cookies, breads, pastry, custards. A cake made without eggs will be a less tender cake. Baking without egg yolks 
eliminates tenderness. Baking without egg whites, eliminates volume.</p> 
<p>Merangue is an excellent example of these traits of eggs. You want the peaks you'll form with them to be as stiff as possible so you 
omit the egg yolk. You bake with the egg whites because once beaten well, they trap air within them and have huge volume. Some cakes will have you carefully fold in beaten egg whites to get that extra 
airyness in the cake. Mix the egg whites in too hard and the cake won't rise as much because the air was beaten out of the whites.</p>

<h2><a id="Liquids">Liquids</a></h2> <!-- Links from a text link on the fruit page -->

<p>When baking, and especially as you begin to experiment with adding flavours your recipe doesn't call for, you'll find yourself adding many different types of liquids to your bakes. Most recipes will 
call for some amount of <b>water</b>. It's the most basic fluid you'll find in baking as it doesn't add its own flavour to the mix and provides fuel for a lot of the chemical reactions that occur during the 
baking process. Just like in animals, if you want life, you need water. Without it, your bakes won't have as much structure since the evaporation of steam helps expand the batters and doughs as they 
bake. It also contributes to texture and moistness. Very important since no one wants to eat dry desserts that paste in your mouth.</p>

<p>Some recipes will call for <b>milk</b> to be added in replacement or in addition to water. My mother and I used to replce water in chocolate cake recipes with milk because we felt it added a nice creamy 
element to the cake. Aside from flavour, milk brings a lot of proteins to baking. More proteins means a stronger structure or good crust. Some bread and custard recipes will call for milk to be scalded 
before adding it to the bowl of ingredients. Too warm and you curdle the milk and cook the eggs once you add the milk to the ingredients bowl. Sometimes, you want a nice warm milk, not unlike the temperature of 
milk you would feed a baby. Warming the milk helps to increase volume because it traps air bubbles as you mix it with eggs and sugars. Cold milk helps create the flakey layers you want in pastries such as biscuits.</p>

<p>You can use low-fat or skim milk in baking. Just use an extra hand when making the batter with either of those options. Wet and dry ingredients will have to be prepared in separate bowls and mixed 
with a light hand to make sure that you don't over mix the ingredients and make a tougher final bake. Many recipes call for wholemilk which has the higher fat/protein content making overmixing not as 
big a worry. Easier than low-fat milks, you can substitute any milk in a recipe with soy, almond, goat, and sheep's milk along with yogurt. Use them at the same ratio as milk in your recipe.</p>

<p>Another option is to add <b>juices</b> to your bakes. Adding juice is a lot more complicated than it sounds. You just might have to experiment a couple times to find the right ratio of ingredients for your bake to 
turn out. You're adding more liquid content to the recipe so you find you have to increase the time spent in the oven to evaporate the extra liquid or you may find it's better to reduce the amount of water or 
milk you add to the batter. Depending on how sweet or acidic the juice is, you may need to reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe or decrease the amount of baking powder you add.</p>
