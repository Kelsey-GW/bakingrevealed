	<p>Everytime my boyfriend and I would take stock of ingredients in the pantry before baking, his mom would ask him what we needed. Usually this would be a nice things since who knows what's in their 
	kitchen more than an owner of said kitchen? Instead, this always devolved into 5-10 minutes of her arguing with him about the ingredients our recipe called for and to just use X thing she has in 
	stock instead. Condensed milk? Too sweet. Use evaporated milk instead. That's too much white sugar and is way too sweet. Use brown instead.</p> 
	
	<p>I would roll my eyes in the other room waiting to go shopping until I started to wonder. Why <em>does</em> this cookie recipe call for more white sugar than brown sugar but this one wants more brown 
	sugar than white? What is the difference between using butter and shortening? Am I going to ruin everything if I add fruit or juice to this cake? People always say cooking is an art but baking is a 
	science. There's a reason a recipe calls for the ingredients it does and in the amounts it does; chemistry. But what chemistry was happening in my cake tin? Why couldn't we simply substitute products 
	like my boyfriend's mom wanted us to?</p> 
	
	<p>Not knowing the science behind it all is an expected position to be in when the majority of recipes will tell you what to add, what temperature and when to move everything onto the next step but very few ever 
	explain why you're following these steps and measurements. I decided I didn't want to feel limited by not knowing the whys behind the recipe steps anymore. This website is a result of that. Everything here are 
	baking tips and facts I have learned and compiled into one place for myself and everyone to use. As I learn more, I'll build up this resource and hopefully clear up anything beginning home bakers wonder about.</p>
