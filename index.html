	<p>Why does this cookie recipe call for more white sugar than brown sugar but this one wants more brown sugar than white? What is the difference between using butter and shortening? Am I going to 
	ruin everything if I add fruit or juice to this cake?These are some of the questions I know <em>I've</em> wondered while baking. I'm sure I'm not alone in that. My boyfriend alone has messed up enough
	simple baking things for me to know that everyone has questions about what to do when baking and why. Most recipes online tell you what to add, what temperature and when to move everything onto the next 
	step but very few ever explained why their recipe outlined to do what they did. I didn't want to feel limited by not knowing the whys behind the recipe steps anymore.</p>
	
	<p>People always say that baking is an art. They think so because they see all those beautiful cakes and pastries lining bakery shelves. And while it's true that decorating desserts is an art, baking 
	them is a science. There's a reason a recipe calls for the ingredients it does and in the amounts it does; Chemistry. But you'll never find a chemistry of baking course outside of dedicated baking and 
	cooking schools. So I decided to find the answers and put them in a conveient resource for everyone to use.</p>
	
	<p>Right now, this resource is rather basic but everything has to start somewhere. As we learn more, we'll build this resource and hopefully we'll be able to clear up anything home bakers wonder about 
	as they bake.</p>
