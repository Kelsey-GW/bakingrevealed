	<p>Here at Baking Revealed, we are always looking to learn more about baking. The sky is the limit with baking so there is never too much 
	knowledge that can be collected. We don't care if you think you are an amateur baker. If you have any other baking or tips shoot us
	an email and share it with us! Seriously. We don't care if your tip is about ingredients, chemistry or the baking process or even what type 
	of baking sheets are best for which job. We want all the tips we can possible listen to. If it is one we haven't heard before, we will be sure to add it here. We are 
	always looking to expand our resource. With your help, we can make this into one of the premier baking tips and trick guides online. And by doing that, you can be a 
	far more knowledgeable baker than you were before you found this site.</p>
