<p>Fruits are a common addition to desserts. They can be baked in the dessert or placed on top to be a beautiful decorative element.
 You can even add vegetables if you want to make a more savoury dessert. Carrots is the most common vegetable added to desserts that
 comes to mind. Apples, blackberries, bananas, passionfruit. Even more floral flavours like rose and lavender can be added to desserts. 
 The world is your oyster. There are 3 ways fruit will be added to desserts:</p>
 
 <ul>
	<li>The meat of the fruit</li>
	<li>Zest and rind</li>
	<li>Fruit juice</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to juices, feel free to visit our <a href="wet.html#Liquids">juice specific section</a> <!-- Links to the liquid section on wets page --> on the wet page. In general, it's not that 
different than adding whole fruit. When you add whole fruit, you should try to pay attention to the flavour and the juice content of the fruit.
 If the fruit is really sweet, you may want to cut down on the amount of sugar you add the bake. If it's quite acidic, you may want to adjust 
 the amount of baking powder or baking soda you add. No matter which fruit you're adding, as long as it's fresh fruit, there is a high chance 
 it will have an affect on your baking time. Fresh fruit brings a lot of moisture to the bake so it will probably take longer to bake. This 
 means you'll want to keep an eye on the edges of your dessert as it rises. You don't want to burn the edges of the dessert to make sure the 
 middle is cooked properly. A slower, lower temperature bake may be a better choice in these cases.</p>
 
 <p>If you want to add zest, do so without worry. Just get your zester and shave off the zest or rind into the batter. Even on top as a 
 decorative element. When baked, the zest and rind will soften right up and add a nice flavour. Just be careful when zesting to not get the 
 pith. The pith tends to be bitter and is usually a flavour to be avoided.</p>
